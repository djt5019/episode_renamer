Episode Renamer v0.1
====================

This utility allows you to easily rename your messy episode files.  It will allow
you to easily rename your files with custom formatting, generate checksums, and
verify file integrity.  Extracts information by making use of the AniDB api,
TheTvDb api, and by scraping epguides.

Logs, databases, renamed file information, and a config file are all saved in the
resources folder.  To edit the default settings open up the config.py file and poke
around.

If your environment does not support UTF-8, which is necessary for properly displaying
some show title, you can make use of the simple gui.  PySide is required in order to
make use of the gui.

Usage
-----

    eplist "Cheers" --season 3 --episode 2
Performs a search for the show "Cheers", then returns the second episode from the third season

    eplist pwd --season 1 --rename .
Uses the current folders name to search for the show, the attempts to rename the episodes from the first season

    eplist "Cheers" -r . --format "<series:proper> - <type> <episode:pad> - <title> [<hash>]"
Renames the episodes in the current directory using show information from cheers using a custom format

    eplist "Baccano" -r . -e 1-5
Renames the first five episodes of the show "Baccano" in the current directory

    eplist pwd --verify
Verifys the integrity of the episode by comparing it to the checksum in the filename (if one is not present it is skipped)

    eplist --gui-enabled
Uses the graphical user interface rather than the command line to rename your shows, allows proper display of utf-8 if your environments console dosent (Windows)

Formatting
----------
This program allows you to use custom formatting to rename your episode files.
The tags can be changed by editing the dictionary in the config.py file in the resources folder.

-   **episode_name_tags**: Will replace the tag with the episodes name
-   **episode_number_tags**: Replaces the tag with the episodes number in the season
-   **episode_count_tags**: Replaces the tag with the episodes total overall number in the series
-   **series_name_tags**: Replaces the tag with the series name
-   **season_number_tags**: Replaces the tag with the episodes season
-   **hash_tags**: If you are renaming files it will replace the tag with the checksum (if it was not previously present in the filename then it will compute it)
-   **type_tags**: Replaces the tag with the episodes type, eg. Episode, DVD, OVA, etc


in addition to the formatting, this program allows you to modify the results of the tags with some
basic text modifiers.  You modify the tag by using \<tagname:mod1:mod2:...:modN\>

-   **pad**: If the output is an integer it will automatically pad zeros
-   **upper**: Capitalize the resulting string
-   **lower**: Convert the string to lower case
-   **proper**: Converts the string to a representation with proper capitalization.
